# This file lists pinned versions for the Raspberry Pi.
# Ideally generated by 'pip-compile requirements-pi.in' on an ARM system,
# or carefully curated for compatibility.
# Example versions are provided.

# --- Core ML / CV (Pi Specific) ---

# IMPORTANT: tflite-runtime
# This package must be installed manually from a specific .whl file
# compatible with your Raspberry Pi's architecture (e.g., armv7l or aarch64)
# and Python version.
# Example:
# # For Python 3.9 on a 64-bit Pi OS (aarch64):
# # pip install https://github.com/google-coral/pycoral/releases/download/v2.0.0/tflite_runtime-2.5.0.post1-cp39-cp39-linux_aarch64.whl
# # (Check TensorFlow Lite official documentation for the correct wheel for your setup)
# # You might list the local .whl file if distributing it with your project:
# # ./wheels/tflite_runtime-2.5.0.post1-cp39-cp39-linux_aarch64.whl
# # Or simply comment it out here and handle installation in a setup script:
# # tflite-runtime # Placeholder - install manually

opencv-python-headless==4.9.0.80 # Check for latest ARM-compatible version
numpy==1.26.4 # Ensure compatibility with other libs on ARM
scipy==1.13.0 # If used

# --- Hardware Interfacing ---
pyserial==3.5

# For Pi Camera (install one, not both, based on your OS and camera module):
picamera2==0.3.19 # For newer Pi OS (Bullseye/Bookworm) and Camera Module 2/3
                 # Usually installed via apt: sudo apt install python3-picamera2
                 # If installing via pip, ensure dependencies like libcamera are met.
#picamera==1.13 # For older Pi OS (Buster) and Camera Module 1
               # Usually installed via apt: sudo apt install python3-picamera

# RPi.GPIO and gpiozero are often managed via 'apt' and might not need to be in pip requirements,
# but if you install them via pip:
RPi.GPIO==0.7.1 # Check for latest
gpiozero==2.0 # Check for latest

# --- Other Project-Specific Libraries ---
Pillow==10.3.0 # Ensure ARM compatibility

# --- Transitive dependencies (examples, pip-compile would resolve these) ---
# These would be dependencies of the above packages, resolved for ARM.
certifi==2024.2.2
charset-normalizer==3.3.2
idna==3.7
packaging==24.0
requests==2.31.0
urllib3==2.2.1
# ... and others specific to the ARM versions of your primary packages.

# --- Optional Additions for Pi (Consider adding if needed) ---
python-dotenv            # For managing environment variables if using a .env file for configs on Pi
configobj                # For handling configuration files if more complex than simple JSON/YAML
