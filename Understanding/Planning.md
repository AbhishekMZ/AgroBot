### 1. Development on the Pi Zero 2 W
- **Direct Development**: If comfortable with the Pi's limitations, develop directly on it using VS Code Remote SSH.
- **Cross-Development**: Develop on your main PC, then transfer code to Pi for testing. This is often more efficient.
- **Use Git**: Set up a Git repository to easily transfer code between your development machine and the Pi.

### 2. Speed Optimization for Pi Zero 2 W
- **Profile code** frequently to find bottlenecks.
- Always **measure actual inference time** on the Pi, not just your development machine.
- Consider **thread prioritization** for critical components.
- Minimize Python memory usage with **object pooling** for frequently created objects.

### 3. INT8 Quantization is Non-Negotiable
- INT8 quantization typically gives **3-4x speedup** over float models.
- Ensure your calibration dataset is representative of real-world conditions.
- Always **validate accuracy after quantization** - sometimes retraining with quantization awareness helps.

### 4. Testing Strategy
- Start with **component-level tests** for HAL modules before integration.
- Create a **staging environment** with similar sensors/actuators before field tests.
- Use **logging extensively** to capture behavior during tests.
- Build a **visualization tool** to see what the model "sees" and how it's interpreting images.
