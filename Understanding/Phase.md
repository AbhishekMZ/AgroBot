AgroBot Software Development Plan
This plan addresses your key areas: initial analysis, software design, model accuracy/performance, and development workflow.

I. Initial Analysis and Understanding
A. Analyzing the Reference Codebase (C:\Users\Mishael Abhishek\Projects\AgroBot\AgroBot_Reference)

Your goal here is to understand its architecture, algorithms, data handling, and identify reusable components or establish a performance baseline.

Explore Directory Structure: Familiarize yourself with how the code and data are organized within AgroBot_Reference.
Identify Key Components:
Model Files: Look for pre-trained model files (e.g., .pb, .h5, .pth, or already converted .tflite).
Training Scripts: Scripts used for training or fine-tuning the model. Note the framework used (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch).
Inference Scripts: Code demonstrating how to load the model and make predictions.
Data Preprocessing: How is image data loaded, resized, normalized, or augmented?
Dataset: Locate the image dataset. Understand its structure (folders for classes, annotation formats like XML, JSON, TXT).
Code Review (Key Scripts):
Understand the model architecture if defined in code.
Note dependencies and libraries used.
Analyze the workflow from input image to output prediction.
Questions to Answer:
What specific ML model/architecture is used? Does it align with restrictions.txt?
What are its reported or observable accuracy and performance metrics (if any)?
What is the format and size of the input data it expects?
Can parts of this code be adapted for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, or will it require significant modification/rewrite?
B. Interpreting restrictions.txt and Synopsis.txt

These are your guiding documents.

restrictions.txt - Key Takeaways (based on previous view):
Target Hardware: Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. This dictates strict limits on computational power and memory.
ML Models: TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) is heavily favored. Specific recommended lightweight architectures include MobileNetV1/V2, EfficientDet-Lite. OpenCV DNN with models like SSD-MobileNet is also an option.
Optimization: INT8 quantization is crucial for performance. Low input resolutions (e.g., 160x160, 224x224) are recommended. Avoid full TensorFlow/PyTorch on the Pi.
Synopsis.txt - Core Project Goals:
AI-driven weed detection (CNNs).
Precise elimination (spraying).
Affordable and adaptable system.
Rover halts, sprays weed, then resumes.
Guiding Principle: Every software design choice, library selection, and model development step must be evaluated against these constraints and goals. If a component from the reference codebase doesn't fit (e.g., uses a heavy PyTorch model), you'll need to adapt or replace it.

II. Software Design for Deployability and Control
A. Architectural Considerations

A modular, layered architecture is essential for managing complexity, testing, and hardware interaction.

Layered Architecture:
Application Layer: Orchestrates the overall workflow (e.g., main control loop, system states).
Core Logic Layer:
AI Inference Module: Handles loading the TFLite model, image preprocessing, running inference, and post-processing results.
Decision Module: Interprets model output to classify plants and decide actions (e.g., "weed detected," "spray," "move forward").
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):
Camera Module: Interface for capturing images from the Pi camera.
Motion Control Module: Interface for controlling the rover's chassis (e.g., move_forward(), stop()). This will likely communicate with an Arduino or a motor driver.
Sprayer Control Module: Interface for activating/deactivating the spraying mechanism (e.g., activate_sprayer(), deactivate_sprayer()).
Communication Module (Optional but Recommended): If using an Arduino for motor/sprayer control, this module handles serial communication between the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. Define a simple, robust protocol (e.g., command strings like "MOVE:FWD", "SPRAY:ON").

B. Designing for Modularity and Adherence to restrictions.txt

Clear Interfaces: Define Python classes or modules for each component in the HAL (e.g., ChassisController, SprayerActuator, PiCamera). The core logic will use these well-defined APIs.
Decoupling: The AI and decision logic should not have direct knowledge of low-level hardware details (GPIO pins, serial commands). This allows you to:
Test core logic on your development PC by "mocking" hardware responses.
Easily adapt to changes in hardware (e.g., different motor driver) by only modifying the HAL.
Ensure HAL implementations are optimized for the Pi Zero 2 W as per restrictions.txt.
Configuration Files: Use configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML) for settings like camera resolution, model paths, serial port details, spray duration, etc., rather than hardcoding.

*III. Model Accuracy and Performance Strategy*
A. Systematic Approach to Improving Model Accuracy (Data-Centric)

Establish a Baseline:
If the reference model can be converted to TFLite and run on the Pi, benchmark its accuracy and speed.
Otherwise, start with a simple, known-to-work TFLite model from restrictions.txt (e.g., MobileNetV2-SSD Lite) trained on a subset of your data.
Key Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score (for weed class), mAP (if object detection), inference time (ms per frame on Pi).
Iterative Data Enhancement:
Leverage AgroBot_Reference Data: Use the dataset from the reference repository as your starting point.
Collect Diverse, Representative Data: This is often the most impactful way to improve accuracy. Capture images under various conditions:
Different lighting (sunny, cloudy, shadows).
Different times of day.
Various crop growth stages and weed types/sizes.
Different soil types and moisture levels.
High-Quality Annotations: Ensure labels are accurate and consistent.
Data Augmentation: Apply aggressive augmentation suitable for plants (flips, rotations, scaling, brightness, contrast, saturation, hue shifts, blur, noise). Use libraries like Albumentations.
Model Training and Optimization (respecting restrictions.txt):
Transfer Learning: Fine-tune pre-trained TFLite-compatible backbones (e.g., MobileNet, EfficientDet-Lite backbones) on your dataset. This is usually more effective than training from scratch with limited data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with learning rate, batch size, optimizer, and regularization.
Model Architecture (if necessary): If standard models aren't sufficient and you have the expertise, explore designing custom lightweight CNNs, but always prioritize TFLite compatibility and performance on the Pi.
Quantization: This is critical.
Start with post-training dynamic range quantization.
Move to post-training INT8 quantization. This requires a representative dataset (a few hundred samples) for calibration. It significantly speeds up inference and reduces model size.
Error Analysis: Regularly analyze your model's mistakes. Are there specific types of weeds or conditions it struggles with? Use this insight to guide further data collection or model adjustments.

B. Benchmarking and Tracking Performance

On-Target Benchmarking: Always measure inference speed and accuracy on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
Use tflite_benchmark_tool for standardized speed tests.
Write scripts to evaluate accuracy on a test set directly on the Pi.
Experiment Logging: Keep a meticulous record of:
Dataset version used.
Augmentation techniques applied.
Model architecture and hyperparameters.
Quantization method.
Resulting accuracy metrics and inference speed on Pi.
(Simple CSV/spreadsheet is fine; tools like MLflow are options for larger projects).
C. Overall Software Performance Optimization (for Pi Zero 2 W)

Efficient Python Code:
Use optimized libraries like NumPy for array operations.
Profile your Python code (cProfile) on the Pi to find bottlenecks.
Minimize memory allocations and data copying.
Image Processing Pipeline: Optimize image capture, resizing, and normalization steps (OpenCV is generally efficient).
Threading/Async (Cautiously): The Pi Zero 2 W has a quad-core CPU. You might use threading for I/O-bound tasks (like waiting for camera frame or serial response) to prevent blocking the main AI processing loop. Be mindful of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) for CPU-bound tasks in Python. asyncio can also be an option.
Lean System: Keep background processes on the Pi to a minimum.

Action: Develop the main application logic on the Pi that:
Captures image.
Runs AI inference.
Makes a decision (weed/no weed).
Commands chassis to stop/move.
Commands sprayer if weed detected.
Action: Begin integration testing in a controlled environment.
Phase 5: Field Testing, Iteration & Enhancement (Ongoing)
Action: Test the AgroBot in increasingly realistic field conditions.
Action: Continuously collect new data, especially for scenarios where the model performs poorly.
Action: Regularly retrain, re-quantize, and re-evaluate your model.
Action: Refine software based on field observations (e.g., timing, robustness).
Integrating New Data:

Establish a routine: Collect -> Annotate -> Add to training set -> Retrain -> Evaluate -> Deploy.
Version your datasets and models.
Testing Practices:

Unit Tests: For pure Python logic (e.g., data parsing, decision rules).
Integration Tests: For interactions (Pi-camera, Pi-AI model, Pi-Arduino).
End-to-End (E2E) Field Tests: The ultimate validation. Test the complete weed detection and spraying cycle in the target environment. Record successes and failures for analysis.
This detailed plan should provide a solid foundation. Remember that restrictions.txt is your most critical constraint document for hardware-related decisions. Good luck with the AgroBot project!
