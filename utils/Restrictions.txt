The Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W can run lightweight ML models, especially those optimized for edge devices. Here are some other models (besides YOLO-tiny) that work reasonably well:

✅ 1. TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) Models
These are optimized for low-power devices like the Pi Zero 2 W:

MobileNet V1/V2 (Image Classification)

Lightweight, decent accuracy, runs in ~1–2s per image

EfficientDet-Lite (Object Detection)

Slower than YOLO-tiny but usable at small input sizes

PoseNet (Human Pose Estimation)

Works with still images, not ideal for real-time

Face Detection / Face Landmark models

Can detect faces and key points (eyes, nose, mouth)

Keyword Spotting (Speech Recognition)

For basic voice control (e.g., "yes", "no", etc.)

✅ 2. OpenCV DNN Models
OpenCV’s deep neural network (DNN) module can run:

SSD-MobileNet (Object Detection)

Similar to YOLO-tiny in performance

Face Detection with Caffe or ONNX models

✅ 3. Custom Trained Models (Quantized to TFLite)
You can convert your own TensorFlow or Keras models to .tflite format and run them on the Pi Zero 2 W if quantized and lightweight.

⚠ Tips for Performance:
Use input resolution like 160×160 or 224×224

Prefer INT8 quantized models (much faster, less RAM)

Avoid PyTorch or full TensorFlow (too heavy for Pi Zero 2 W)
